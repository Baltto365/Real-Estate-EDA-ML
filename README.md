An American Real Estate Company wants to understand every aspect of the residential homes pricing market  in Ames, Iowa, with a view of establishing an outlet in Iowa.

Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of homes, with a view of creating a web application that will be able to predict the price of house given its features.

The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house.
How well do those variables describe the price of a house.

As Data Scientist, I was required to explore the Dataset, and come up with insights that will aid the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly fit their business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. This Exploration will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of the housing and estate  market.


I will apply data visualization techniques to carry out an exploration of the data set. I will also carry out Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis to explore, figure out relationships and identify insights from the Data set.
